          <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a web developer with a background in art and education from London.</p>
            <p>I have always  been creative, loved art and anything to do with it. After spending 15 years teaching Art and inspiring young minds to create it,  I decided to take a plunge and challenge myself with something that was always my desire to do - learn to code.
  I did the  GA WDI course that proved to be challenging but above all inspiring and exciting. I immensely enjoyed the challenge of solving problems and then the thrill of managing to solve them. I am amazed how the three  months on the course passed so quickly and during which I was able to learn so much which enables me to create something that can potentially be used by so many people. I would love to be able to continue learning and improving my skills to feed my own desire to create beautiful and functional websites that help others.
